Tabbed widget
============

A 'lil three-tabbed widget, loading data in from the Guardian content API.

To run it, just open `/dist/index.html` in a browser.

Making changes
--------------

This project uses Gulp to compile SASS to CSS, and Babel to transpile modern Javascript into something that will work in older browsers.

The output files in `/dist` are committed to this repo for convenience, but if you want to make changes, you'll need to overwrite them.

To do that, run `npm install` and then `gulp` to update to the dist folder and watch for subsequent changes. You'll need `node` and `npm` installed.
